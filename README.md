## About This Project

Welcome to Data Doodles. This repository is a curated collection of rich, interactive web experiences, where each "doodle" is a deep dive into a specific topic.

Every visualization is built from the ground up to be a standalone, single-file artifact. They are designed to be explored, shared, and used as a resource for learning and understanding complex subjects through a clean, accessible, and engaging interface.

## Core Principles

Each visualization in this collection is crafted to meet a strict set of quality standards, ensuring a consistent and high-quality experience for every user.

  - **Universally Accessible:** Built to WCAG 2.1 AA standards, ensuring content is usable by everyone, including people with disabilities.
  - **Fully Responsive:** Delivers a seamless experience on any device, from a small mobile phone to an 8K desktop monitor.
  - **High Performance:** Optimized for near-instant load times and smooth interaction, with no external libraries besides Chart.js.
  - **Completely Self-Contained:** Every visualization is a single HTML file. There are no dependencies to manage, making them incredibly portable and easy to archive or share.
  - **Trustworthy Content:** Each piece is founded on verifiable data from reputable sources, which are cited within the visualization itself.

## Methodology

The creation process for each visualization is guided by a comprehensive design specification. This blueprint dictates everything from the narrative structure and data integrity to the technical implementation, ensuring that every piece adheres to the core principles of accessibility, performance, and user-focused design. This structured approach allows for the consistent production of high-quality, in-depth digital content.

## License

The code for each visualization is open source and available under the [MIT License](https://github.com/shfqrkhn/Data-Doodles/blob/main/LICENSE). You are free to inspect, learn from, and adapt the work for your own projects.
